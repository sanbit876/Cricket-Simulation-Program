# Cricket-Simulation-Program

# Introduction

The "Cricket Simulation Program" is a Python-based application to provide a simulation of a cricket match. By leveraging suitable algorithms and efficient data structures such as dictionaries and lists, the program efficiently represents and manipulates tournament data. It follows the principles of object-oriented programming, utilizing classes to encapsulate player information, team dynamics, field conditions, umpire decisions, and commentator commentary.

# Methodology

The methodology used in creating the "Cricket Simulation Program" encompasses the following steps:

1.) Requirement Gathering: Gathering the program requirements, understanding the desired features, and defining the level of detail for the simulation.

2.) Design and Planning: A systematic design approach is followed to plan the structure and components of the program. Object-oriented principles are employed to create classes representing players, teams, field conditions, umpires, and commentators. The relationships between these classes are established to ensure proper interaction and flow of information.

3.) Modular Development: The program is developed in a modular manner to promote reusability and maintainability. Each class is implemented as a separate module, focusing on encapsulation and separation of concerns. This allows for easy modification or extension of individual components without affecting the entire codebase.

4.) Data Structure and Algorithm Selection: Appropriate data structures and algorithms are chosen to efficiently store and manipulate the tournament data. Dictionaries and lists are used to represent player statistics, team compositions, match scores, and other relevant information. Algorithms are designed to simulate player performances and determine match outcomes based on probabilistic calculations.

5.) Adherence to Python Coding Conventions: The program strictly follows PEP 8 guidelines for code style and formatting. Clear and meaningful names are assigned to variables, functions, and classes. Proper indentation, comments, and docstrings are used to enhance code readability and maintainability.

# Running the program

In order to run the program simple type in command-line:
```
> python main.py
```
